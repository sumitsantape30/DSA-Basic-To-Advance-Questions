Magnets

1. You are given n number of domino shaped bipolar magnets.
2. You have to place these magnets in M*N following the conditions.
3. Conditions are -
   a. Each box of 1*2 or 2*1 can contain a magnet or can be empty.
   b. Empty box can be represented by X's and magnets are represented by + and 
    - sign.
   c. Digits along left and top side of the board represents the number of + in 
    corresponding rows and columns.
   d. Digits along right and bottom of the board represents the number of - in 
    corresponding rows and columns.
    e. -1 denotes that the corresponding row and column can have any number of 
    +  and - signs.
    f. No two adjacent cell can have the same sign.


Note -> Check out the question video and write the recursive code as it is intended without changing signature. The judge can't force you but intends you to teach a concept.
Input Format
A number M
A number N
M*N characters containing only 'L', 'R', 'T' and 'B'.
(For 1*2 box 'L' represents left end and 'R' represents the right end)
(For 2*1 box 'T' represents top end and 'B' represents the right end)
N integers representing count of '+' along the top edge.
M integers representing count of '+' along the left edge.
M integers representing count of '-' along the right edge.
N integers representing count of '-' along the bottom edge.
