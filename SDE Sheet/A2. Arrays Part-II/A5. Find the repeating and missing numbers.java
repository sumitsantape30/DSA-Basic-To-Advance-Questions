Problem Statement: You are given a read-only array of N integers with values also in the range [1, N] both inclusive. Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing. The task is to find the repeating and missing numbers A and B where A repeats twice and B is missing.

Example 1:
Input Format:  array[] = {3,1,2,5,3}
Result: {3,4)
Explanation: A = 3 , B = 4 
Since 3 is appearing twice and 4 is missing
  
Example 2:
Input Format: array[] = {3,1,2,5,4,6,7,5}
Result: {5,8)
Explanation: A = 5 , B = 8 
Since 5 is appearing twice and 8 is missing
