Exit Point Of A Matrix

1. You are given a number n, representing the number of rows.
2. You are given a number m, representing the number of columns.
3. You are given n*m numbers (1's and 0's), representing elements of 2d array a.
4. Consider this array a maze and a player enters from top-left corner in east direction.
5. The player moves in the same direction as long as he meets '0'. On seeing a 1, he takes a 90 deg right turn.
6. You are required to print the indices in (row, col) format of the point from where you exit the matrix.
