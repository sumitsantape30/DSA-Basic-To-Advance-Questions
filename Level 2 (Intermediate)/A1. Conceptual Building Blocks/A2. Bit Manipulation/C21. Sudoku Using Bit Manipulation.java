Sudoku Using Bit Manipulation

1. You are give a partially filled 9*9 2-D array(arr) which represents an incomplete sudoku state.
2. You are required to assign the digits from 1 to 9 to the empty cells following some rules.
Rule 1 -> Digits from 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
Rule 2 -> Digits from 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
Rule 3 -> Digits from 1-9 must occur exactly once in each 3x3 sub-array of the given 2D array.

Assumption -> The given Sudoku puzzle will have a single unique solution.
Note -> You have to Solve this problem using bits.
Input Format
9*9 integers ranging from 1 to 9.
0 represents an empty cell.
Output Format
You have to print the solved sudoku.
