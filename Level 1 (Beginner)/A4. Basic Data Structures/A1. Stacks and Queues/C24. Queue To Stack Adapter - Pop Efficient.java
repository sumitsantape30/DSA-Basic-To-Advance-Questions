Queue To Stack Adapter - Pop Efficient

1. You are required to complete the code of our QueueToStackAdapter class. 
2. As data members you've two queues available - mainQ and helperQ. mainQ is to contain data and helperQ is to assist in operations. (This is cryptic - take hint from video)
3. Here is the list of functions that you are supposed to complete
     3.1. push -> Should accept new data in LIFO manner.
     3.2. pop -> Should remove and return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print 
     "Stack underflow" and return -1.
    3.3. top -> Should return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print "Stack 
    underflow" and return -1.
    3.4. size -> Should return the number of elements available in the stack.
4. Input and Output is managed for you.

Note -> pop, top and size should work in constant time. push should work in linear time.
