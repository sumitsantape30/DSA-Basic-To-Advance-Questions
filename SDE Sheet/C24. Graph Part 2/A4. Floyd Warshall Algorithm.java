Problem Statement: The problem is to find the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge-weighted directed graph. The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix of size n*n. Matrix[i][j] denotes the weight of the edge from i to j. If Matrix[i][j]=-1, it means there is no edge from i to j.

Do it in place.

Example 1:

Input Format: 
matrix[][] = { {0, 2, -1, -1},
        {1, 0, 3, -1},{-1, -1, 0, -1},{3, 5, 4, 0} }

Result:
0 2 5 -1 
1 0 3 -1 
-1 -1 0 -1 
3 5 4 0 
Explanation: In this example, the final matrix 
is storing the shortest distances. For example, matrix[i][j] is 
storing the shortest distance from node i to j.
Example 2:

Input Format: 
matrix[][] = {{0,25},
              {-1,0}}

Result:   
0 25  
-1 0ï»¿
Explanation: In this example, the shortest distance 
is already given (if it exists).
