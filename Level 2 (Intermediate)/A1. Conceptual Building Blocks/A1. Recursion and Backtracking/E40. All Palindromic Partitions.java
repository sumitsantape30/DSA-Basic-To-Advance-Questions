All Palindromic Partitions

1. You are given a string of length n.
2. You have to partition the given string in such a way that every partition is a palindrome.

Note -> Check out the question video and write the recursive code as it is intended without 
               changing signature. The judge can't force you but intends you to teach a concept.
