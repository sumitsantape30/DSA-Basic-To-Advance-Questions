= Write code for multiple components whether it is DFS or BFS.
= Take visited array and initialise as 0
           for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) { //start i from 1 if the graph has 1 based indexing
                if (!visited [ i ] ) {
                         write code for either BFS or DFS
                }
           }
= How to find the number of components?
  Count the number of time your code goes inside the if statement.
