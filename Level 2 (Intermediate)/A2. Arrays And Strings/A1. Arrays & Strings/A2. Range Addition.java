Range Addition

1. Assume you have an array of length 'n' initialized with all 0's and are given 'q' queries to update.
2. Each query is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.
3. Return the modified array after all 'q' queries were executed.
Input Format
length = 5,
updates = 
{
    {1,  3,  2},
    {2,  4,  3},
    {0,  2, -2}
}
Output Format
return {-2, 0, 3, 5, 3}
Explanation : 
Initial state:
{ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }
After applying operation [1, 3, 2]:
{ 0, 2, 2, 2, 0 }
After applying operation [2, 4, 3]:
{ 0, 2, 5, 5, 3 }
After applying operation [0, 2, -2]:
{-2, 0, 3, 5, 3 }
