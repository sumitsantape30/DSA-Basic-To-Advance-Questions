Find Anagram Mappings

1. You are given two integer arrays(A and B), where B is an anagram of A.
2. B is an anagram of A means B is made by randomizing the order of the elements in A.
3. For every element in A, you have to print the index of that element in B.

Note -> Both arrays(A and B) are of the same length.
Input Format
A number N
a1
a2.. N numbers
b1
b2.. N numbers
Output Format
N space separated integers.

Constraints
1 <= length of both arrays <= 10^4
1 <= A[i],B[i] <= 10^5
Sample Input
6
1 2 3 4 5 2
4 3 2 1 5 2
Sample Output
3 2 1 0 4 5
