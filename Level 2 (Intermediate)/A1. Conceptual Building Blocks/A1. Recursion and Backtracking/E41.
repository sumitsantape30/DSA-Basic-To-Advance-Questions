Pattern Matching

1. You are given a string and a pattern. 
2. You've to check if the string is of the same structure as pattern without using any regular 
     expressions.

Note -> Check out the question video and write the recursive code as it is intended without 
               changing signature. The judge can't force you but intends you to teach a concept.
Input Format

A pattern ptr
